          I am a self taught Front Edn Developer. I have had the help of a
          mentor for several months. I focussed on learning{' '}
          <strong>JavaScriptâ€™s </strong>
          fundamentals and moving primarily to <strong>React</strong>. With it I
          build a few projects, mostly on <strong>Next JS</strong>, that involve
          the use and understanding of{' '}
          <strong>Bootstrap, Firebase, React-Hook-Form, Sanity, NodeJS</strong>{' '}
          and some other functional tools such <strong>GitHub</strong> and{' '}
          <strong>Trello</strong>.

          I am also determined to grow as a developer and as value for the
          company. I will keep studying the frameworks I am going to work with
          for better understanding and knowledge and the new technologies that
          might be required using in order to perform the tasks assigned.
