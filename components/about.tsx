          I am a self taught Front Edn Developer. I have had the help of a
          mentor for several months. I focussed on learning JavaScriptâ€™s
          fundamentals and moving primarily to React. With it I build a few
          projects, mostly on Next JS, that involve the use and understanding of
          HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, TypeScript, Firebase, React-Hook-Form, Node and
          some other functional tools such GitHub and Trello.

          I am also determined to grow as a developer and as value for the
          company. I will keep studying the frameworks I am going to work with
          for better understanding and knowledge and the new technologies that
          might be required using in order to perform the tasks assigned.
